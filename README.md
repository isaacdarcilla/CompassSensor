# CompassSensor
This project was created using one of the universal app templates available in Visual Studio. 

This project allows the user to view the compass reading as a magnetic-north and, depending on the installed
sensor, a true-north value. You can choose one of three scenarios:
  *Compass data events
  *Poll compass readings
  *Sensor calibration
